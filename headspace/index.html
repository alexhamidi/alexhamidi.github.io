      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Your mindset might be the most powerful tool you'll ever have. Here's why.</p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Imagine thinking there's nothing left for you to gain from where you are right now.</p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">You wake up convinced you're just going through the motions—that real growth is happening somewhere else, with different people, in different rooms. The lectures feel basic, your classmates seem oblivious, the clubs add nothing. And here's the thing: by the end of each day, you'll find proof you were right all along.</p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Your brain actively hunts for confirmation. When you've already decided there's nothing to discover, you stop seeing opportunities entirely. They become invisible. So what's actually happening here?</p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed font-semibold">The moment you decide you're done learning is the moment you are.</p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">It's a perfect loop.</p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Once you convince yourself you've peaked in some domain, you've built a ceiling. No amount of exposure will change that. Someone brilliant could walk in with a better perspective, and you'll find reasons to ignore them. Their ideas won't be compatible with what you "know."</p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">So how do you avoid this? Because it's insidious—the more expertise you develop, the easier it becomes to believe you've arrived.</p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">The fix is simpler than it sounds. Start each day assuming there's depth you haven't seen yet. Actually listen when people talk. Question what you're certain about.</p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed font-semibold">Believing you still have things to learn is what lets you keep learning.</p>
